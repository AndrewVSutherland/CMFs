[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 Third, I'd like to give you an update on where things sta
nd.  It looks like we now have a complete data set for Nk^2 <= 1000 and k >= 2,
 modulo a few issues with the complex embeddings / L-function data that I need 
to follow up with Edgar tomorrow.  We also have pari data for k=1 computed by J
C, and data computed by AB for all the dihedral forms, (I also discovered that 
Magma can also compute the dihedral cases), so I think we are in a good positio
n to add weight 1 data, which we will work on this week.[]

 k=1), this range covers 5533 (Galois orbits of) spaces S_k^new(N,chi), of whic
h 2653 are non-trivial.  Among these there are 4843 irreducible Galois stable s
ubspaces, corresponding to 4843 (Galois orbits of) newforms.  The total dimensi
on is 145398 (so this is the total number of degree-2 L-functions).[]

degree <= 20, and we now have canonical (polredabs) defining polynomials for al
l of them, allowing us to conclude that there are only 1128 distinct Hecke fiel
ds in this data set, of which 597 are not (yet) in the LMFDB (the smallest miss
ing field is x^4+35x^2+142, with discriminant 980706528 (which is outside the r
ange covered by the LMFDB).  You can find a list of these 1128 fields in the fi
le hecke_fields_1000.txt in the github repo, along with the LMFDB labels of the
 531 that are in the LMFDB.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 For all 3707 of the newforms with coefficient field degre
e <= 20 we have computed algebraic a_n for 1 <= n <= 1000 using the wonderfully
 nice LLL-basis computed by JV's code.  I modified JV's code to go ahead and co
mpute the exact index of the coefficient ring in the maximal order whenever we 
have a polredabs poly (if we can polredabs we should not be afraid to factor th
e discriminant), so we now know the exact value of the index (which can be surp
risingly large).[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 To compare to the current Mongo DB database of modular fo
rms, within this range only 2373 newforms are present, and this includes some d
uplicates (the currently implementation usually stores only one newform per Gal
ois orbit, but sometimes it stores more than one), so currently the LMFDB is mi
ssing more than half of the newforms we computed last week; the smallest is the
 form 26.2.25 (see http://www.lmfdb.org/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/26/2/25/)
.  We are also storing a lot more coefficients than are currently available.[] 

 []


Overfull \hbox (2145.8979pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 135--135
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 On the other hand the current database contains a lot of 
newforms that are well outside our Nk^2 <= 1000 range, although in most cases i
t only contains a few forms in each S_k^{new}(Gamma_1(N)) (often only one examp
le with non-trivial character).  In total there are (at most) 8664 newforms in 
the current database.  If we were to expand our range to Nk^2 <= 4000 we would 
hit far more than this (for Nk^2 <= 2000 we already get more than 15000 newform
s).[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (2582.79817pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 135--135

a/ or http://www.lmfdb.org/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/4/99/3/a/, but these a
re isolatedcases that I don't think are worth pursuing.  I note that it only ta
kes 10-15 minutes to compute these examples in magma (which is less than the ha
rdest examples in the Nk^2 <= 1000 range), so we could certainly replicate the 
cherry picked cases if we wanted to, but I see absolutely no reason to do this.

Overfull \hbox (3646.3054pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 135--135
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 Running on 64 cores the magma code now takes about 1.5 ho
urs to compute all the data for Nk^2 <= 1000, and for Nk^2 <= 2000 I think it w
ill take about 36-48 hours (I kicked this off last night and about 10 threads a
re still running).  The time is actually dominated by computing 1000 exact eige
nvalues for all the degree <= 20 cases, if we lowered the number of coefficient
s and or the degree bound it would be faster, but I actually think we could get
 to Nk^2 <= 4000 if we are willing to throw enough cores at it and/or wait a fe
w weeks.  Given that JC's pari code is 10-20 times faster than the magma code, 
there is certainly no problem getting algebraic data in this range, it's more a
 question of validating it.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 I guess my main question for AB and JB is this: what do y
ou think about the feasibility of getting L-function data for the range Nk^2 <=
 4000 in the near term (i.e. the next few weeks)?  (or Nk^2 <= 2000 if that is 
significantly easier)?[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 In my view the data we have for Nk^2 <= 1000 is already c
learly better than what is currently available (especially if we can include we
ight 1), but it would really be a slam dunk if we had Nk^2 <= 4000, which I thi
nk this is entirely feasible on the algebraic side.  Another option would be to
 only include L-functions for a smaller range, but this seems a shame to do, gi
ven how much of the data has already been computed.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 Thanks for this!  I notice that in fact you computed a lo
t more spaces than N*k <= 1000.  I extracted the lines with N*k <= 1000 from al
l.txt and sorted them by N,k,char-orbit-index (the first 3 fields in each row).
  There are a total of 41265 spaces, of which 19840 are empty, and the total ru
n time was 575275s.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 I uploaded the files mfdecomp_500.m.txt and mfdecomp_500.
gp.txt to your repo which contain corresponding data for the 14259 spaces with 
N*k <= 500, of which 6853 are non-empty.  I should note that in the magma file 
the timings for N=1 and N=2 are a lie, I cheated on those (basically by assumin
g Maeda) but my cheat exactly matches both your data and data I previously comp
uted in magma, so I'm not worried about correctness here.  Impressively, even i
f I ignore N=1,2 (and N=2 is by far the most time-consuming case for magma, for
 k>400 and divisible by 4 each space takes more than half a day), I get a total
 cpuy time of 64894s for magma vs 3394 for gp, so Karim has bought as about a f
actor of 20 speedup.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 JV is right, the A-L operators W_M for M||N map S_k(N,chi
) to S_k(N,chi') with some explicit dependence of chi' on chi, M, N.  In genera
l chi' is different from chi so they are no use for splitting up spaces.[]

as [floor(d/2),ceil(d/2)].  I know this is true up to weight 400, and I'm guess
ing this is actually a theorem?[]
