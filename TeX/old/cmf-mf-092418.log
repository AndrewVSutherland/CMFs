[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 Third, I'd like to give you an update on where things sta
nd.  It looks like we now have a complete data set for Nk^2 <= 1000 and k >= 2,
 modulo a few issues with the complex embeddings / L-function data that I need 
to follow up with Edgar tomorrow.  We also have pari data for k=1 computed by J
C, and data computed by AB for all the dihedral forms, (I also discovered that 
Magma can also compute the dihedral cases), so I think we are in a good positio
n to add weight 1 data, which we will work on this week.[]

 k=1), this range covers 5533 (Galois orbits of) spaces S_k^new(N,chi), of whic
h 2653 are non-trivial.  Among these there are 4843 irreducible Galois stable s
ubspaces, corresponding to 4843 (Galois orbits of) newforms.  The total dimensi
on is 145398 (so this is the total number of degree-2 L-functions).[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 Among the 4843 newforms, 3707 have coefficient fields of 
degree <= 20, and we now have canonical (polredabs) defining polynomials for al
l of them, allowing us to conclude that there are only 1128 distinct Hecke fiel
ds in this data set, of which 597 are not (yet) in the LMFDB (the smallest miss
ing field is x^4+35x^2+142, with discriminant 980706528 (which is outside the r
ange covered by the LMFDB).  You can find a list of these 1128 fields in the fi

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 For all 3707 of the newforms with coefficient field degre
e <= 20 we have computed algebraic a_n for 1 <= n <= 1000 using the wonderfully
 nice LLL-basis computed by JV's code.  I modified JV's code to go ahead and co
mpute the exact index of the coefficient ring in the maximal order whenever we 
have a polredabs poly (if we can polredabs we should not be afraid to factor th
e discriminant), so we now know the exact value of the index (which can be surp
risingly large).[]

Overfull \hbox (2565.55211pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 147--147
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 To compare to the current Mongo DB database of modular fo
rms, within this range only 2373 newforms are present, and this includes some d
uplicates (the currently implementation usually stores only one newform per Gal
ois orbit, but sometimes it stores more than one), so currently the LMFDB is mi
ssing more than half of the newforms we computed last week; the smallest is the
 form 26.2.25 (see http://www.lmfdb.org/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/26/2/25/)
.  We are also storing a lot more coefficients than are currently available.[] 

 []


Overfull \hbox (2145.8979pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 147--147
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 On the other hand the current database contains a lot of 
newforms that are well outside our Nk^2 <= 1000 range, although in most cases i
t only contains a few forms in each S_k^{new}(Gamma_1(N)) (often only one examp
le with non-trivial character).  In total there are (at most) 8664 newforms in 
the current database.  If we were to expand our range to Nk^2 <= 4000 we would 
hit far more than this (for Nk^2 <= 2000 we already get more than 15000 newform
s).[] 
 []


Overfull \hbox (2582.79817pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 147--147
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 We would still be missing some forms that are in the curr

a/ or http://www.lmfdb.org/ModularForm/GL2/Q/holomorphic/4/99/3/a/, but these a
re isolatedcases that I don't think are worth pursuing.  I note that it only ta
kes 10-15 minutes to compute these examples in magma (which is less than the ha
rdest examples in the Nk^2 <= 1000 range), so we could certainly replicate the 
cherry picked cases if we wanted to, but I see absolutely no reason to do this.

Overfull \hbox (3646.3054pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 147--147
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 Running on 64 cores the magma code now takes about 1.5 ho
urs to compute all the data for Nk^2 <= 1000, and for Nk^2 <= 2000 I think it w
ill take about 36-48 hours (I kicked this off last night and about 10 threads a
re still running).  The time is actually dominated by computing 1000 exact eige
nvalues for all the degree <= 20 cases, if we lowered the number of coefficient
s and or the degree bound it would be faster, but I actually think we could get
 to Nk^2 <= 4000 if we are willing to throw enough cores at it and/or wait a fe
w weeks.  Given that JC's pari code is 10-20 times faster than the magma code,

r which computing the char poly of T2 was almost hopeless.  (This was level 3^6

im 3 or 4 weeks ago, he asked me to send him the matrix which I did, and a few 
days after that I heard from Claus Fieker who had a probably result (the char p
oly) which he had computed mod p for lots of primes (choosing those which split
 completely in Q(chi) as I had been doing) and then Chinese Remaindering these.
  He could not certify the result only because I had not told him that we know 
a theoretical bound on the eigenvalues and hence on the coefficients.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 We think of each d-dimensional newform as one object f re
presenting a Galois orbit of newforms.  We have been concentrating on how best 
to write such an object down, via its sequence of coefficients a_n all belongin
g to the Hecke field F of degree d.  The various schemes we have come up with (
expressing the a_n in terms of a power basis for F, or in terms of an integral 
basis for some order in F) seem rather ad hoc and all about how to represent a 
sequence (a_n) of elements of F, regardless of the fact that these are the coef
ficients of a modular form.[]

Overfull \hbox (3876.25291pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 557--557
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 Now, f and its Galois conjugates span a d-dimensional com
plex vector space V_C;  also the Q-bar span of f is a d-dimensional space over 
Q-bar (but we don't get an F-vector space unless F is Galois).  And -- this is 
my point -- this space has a Q-structure too: the subset of forms in the space 
whose q-expansions are in Q forms a d-dimensional vector space V_Q over Q.  Mor
eover, if we fix a Q-basis for the field F, say beta_1,...,beta_d, and write ea
ch a_n as a Q-linear combination of the betas, then we can rearrange the q-expa
nsion of f to express f as a linear combination with coefficients beta_1,...,be
ta_d of d q-expansions with rational coefficients, and these are Q-linearly ind
ependent and span the Q-vector space V_Q.  (This is easy to prove.)[]

Overfull \hbox (5296.17879pt too wide) in paragraph at lines 557--557
[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 So that gives another view of what we have been doing.   
There is a well-defined Q-vector space V_Q of dimension d, namely the subset of
 the d-dimensional C-vector space consisting of forms whose q-expansions are in
 Q[[q]].  In that space there's a Z-lattice V_Z (forms in Z[[q]]).  We can find
 a nice Z-basis for that lattice (LLL-reduction etc) by taking any Q-basis for 
F and expressing the a_n in terms of that basis, then picking out the i'th coef
ficients for 1<=i<=d, and doing easy algebra.   This lattice V_Z is a well-defi
ned object whose definition does not even require us to know what the field F i
s.  The Hecke algebra acts on V_Q and preserves V_Z  (that takes a little thoug
ht when Q)chi) is nontrivial, but is surely true), so has an integral matrix re
presentation.  The newform f itself is then just a simultaneous eigenvector for
 all these integral matrices, i.e. a non-zero element of F^d (whose algebraic G
alois conjugates give the conjugate newforms, w.r.t. the same basis for V_Z).[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/10.95 I don't think that this viewpoint helps us in our computa
tions, but (for me at least) it helps me think about what we are storing, also 
perhaps what we should be displaying.  We could display the initial parts of al
l d integral q-expansions, as a basis for the space (so far not needing to ment
ion F at all); then say what F is and somehow display the eigenvector in F^d an
d say that its coordinates are the coefficients of (one of) the newforms in the
 space.  The Z-basis we give would of course be primitive.  That means that the
 trace form would not necessarily be a basis element (e.g. when F=Q(sqrt(2)) al
l traces from Z[sqrt(2)] are even to the trace form is not primitive), but we c
ould have a convention that the trace form is a multiple of the first basis q-e
xpansion.[]

re 1 and 4.  The first space is harmless.  Looking at the second, of dimension 
160:   the an coefficients are tiny, out of all 160*1000 the maximum value is 7
 with 80% being 0!  I guess this is consistent with known facts about the coeff
icients of weight 1 forms.  Also the traces are between -47 and +166 (the theor
etical bound would be 2*16=320.  So what is so huge?  The basis matrix!   As a 
string it has length 106291519 so accounts for the vast majority of what is sto
red in that output file.  The common denominator for the 160x160 rational entri
